# Decentragram (In Progress)

This repo aims to create a decentralized version of Instagram that gives content creators more control over their content and the ability to monetize. The biggest challenge content creators face is monetization since Facebook/Instagram keeps the majority of the profits (unlike YouTube, Facebook/Instagram only offers an exclusive revenue sharing programme with the largest content creators).

To addrss these challenges,  some of the things that will be included in this new decentralized social network are:

* Each media content creators upload will be minted as an NFT. The NFTs can be transfered but the original creator can earn xfer fees/royalties 
* Users will be able to tip the content creators for their posts
